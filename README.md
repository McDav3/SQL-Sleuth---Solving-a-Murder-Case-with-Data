Project Overview: Crime Investigation Using SQL

In this project, I conducted a full-scale data investigation to solve a fictional murder case set in SQL City. The goal was to simulate how structured data and logical reasoning can be used to uncover hidden patterns, validate eyewitness reports, and identify both a suspect and an accomplice through evidence-based analysis.

The dataset included multiple relational tables covering crime reports, personal identities, gym memberships, check-in histories, event attendance, and interview transcripts. By connecting these disparate sources, I recreated the timeline of events, identified key individuals, and traced the murder back to its orchestrator.

This project highlights my ability to:
- Work across multiple structured datasets in a normalized database
- Apply deductive logic to navigate ambiguous or partial information
- Extract insights from both behavioral data (e.g., gym and event check-ins) and personal attributes (e.g., physical descriptions, vehicle information)
- Translate narrative-based problems into data-driven investigations

Ultimately, I uncovered the murderer by linking eyewitness testimony to gym and license records, and then identified the mastermind using physical attributes, car details, and event attendance patterns.
